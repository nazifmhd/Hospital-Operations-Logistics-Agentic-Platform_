# Frontend Fix Summary for BedFloorPlanVisualization Component

## Issue
Frontend React component was getting error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'floor')"

## Root Cause
The frontend TypeScript interface expected bed data with nested location structure:
```tsx
interface Bed {
  location: {
    floor: number;
    wing: string;
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
}
```

But the backend API was returning flat structure:
```json
{
  "floor": "1",
  "department_id": "dept_icu",
  "number": "001"
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Bed Interface
Changed from nested location structure to flat structure matching the actual API response:
```tsx
interface Bed {
  id: string;
  number: string;            // was bed_number
  room_number: string;
  department_id: string;
  department_name: string;
  bed_type: string;
  status: string;
  current_patient_id?: string;  // was patient_id
  patient_name?: string;
  admission_date?: string;
  floor: string;             // was location.floor
  last_cleaned?: string;
}
```

### 2. Fixed getFilteredBeds Function
```tsx
// Before:
let filtered = beds.filter(bed => bed.location.floor === selectedFloor);

// After:
let filtered = beds.filter(bed => bed.floor === selectedFloor.toString());
```

### 3. Fixed getFloors Function
```tsx
// Before:
const floors = Array.from(new Set(beds.map(bed => bed.location.floor))).sort();

// After:
const floors = Array.from(new Set(beds.map(bed => bed.floor))).sort();
```

### 4. Simplified Wing Grouping
Since backend doesn't provide wing data, simplified to default:
```tsx
// Before:
const wing = bed.location.wing || 'Main Wing';

// After:
const wing = 'Main Wing'; // Simplified since backend doesn't provide wing data
```

### 5. Updated Property References
Fixed all references from `bed_number` to `number` to match API response:
- Tooltip displays
- Dialog titles
- Detail views

## Backend API Endpoints Working
✅ `/bed_management/query` - Returns beds with floor field
✅ `/admission_discharge/beds` - Returns beds with floor field
✅ Database migration completed - floor field added to beds table

## Expected Result
The BedFloorPlanVisualization component should now:
1. Successfully load bed data from the backend
2. Filter beds by floor without errors
3. Display bed information correctly
4. No more "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'floor')" errors
