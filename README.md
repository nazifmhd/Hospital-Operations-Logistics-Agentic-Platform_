# Hospital Operations & Logistics Agentic Platform

## 🏥 Project Overview

An intelligent, agent-based platform that autonomously monitors, manages, and optimizes key hospital operations including bed management, equipment tracking, staff allocation, and supply inventory through a modular, scalable system of cooperative agents.

## 🎯 Goal Statement

Design and develop an intelligent platform that leverages autonomous agents to streamline hospital operations, reduce manual overhead, and improve patient care through real-time monitoring and optimization of critical resources.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

### Core Agents
1. **Bed Management Agent** - Monitors bed availability, occupancy, and turnover
2. **Equipment Tracker Agent** - Tracks medical equipment location and maintenance
3. **Staff Allocation Agent** - Optimizes staff scheduling and workload distribution
4. **Supply Inventory Agent** - Manages inventory levels, procurement, and supply chain

## 🚀 Current Development Focus
